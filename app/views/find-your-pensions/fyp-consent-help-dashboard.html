          </h2>
          <p>
            If you agree to this, MoneyHelper can store your information and preferences. This means when you access your account after your first search they will be able to retrieve the pension information you have already searched for automatically (also displaying any updated value information).
          </p>

            If you do not agree to this consent, when you next access your account, after your first login, you will have to go through the entire process of searching for your pensions again.

            <li>consent expiry information</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This consent will expire after eighteen months when you will be asked to consent again.
          </p>
